# 💜 Hey, I’m **Paulo** - but some know me as Pew.

I'm a full-stack developer and systems architect building **practical**, **automated**, and **accessible** solutions for real problems.  
From Discord bots to AI-based support tools, from Flutter apps to system dashboards, I like to work where the duct tape ends and the real system begins.

Currently leading **[Pew’s Cavern](https://github.com/Pews-Cavern)** - a development company focused on efficiency, accessibility and clever solutions for teams and businesses. I also teach tech mentoring courses in companies, and I work as a Developer at [CELEPAR](https://www.celepar.pr.gov.br/), the information technology company of my state.  
I also study **Systems Analysis and Development** at [Tuiuti University](https://tuiuti.edu.br/), while constantly prototyping ideas, launching experiments and helping people build things that work.
